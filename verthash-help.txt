The verthash data file must be named verthash.dat and located in the same
directory as the cpuminer executable. A Linux symlink works.

The verthash data file must be obtained seperately. If you already use
VerthashMiner you can simply copy or link the existing data file to the
cpuminer directory, using the required name.

Otherwise it may be created using
https://github.com/CryptoGraphics/VerthashMiner/releases
following the instructions. A GPU is not necessary to create the file.

The same data file can be used by both cpuminer and VerthashMiner
simultaneously.

Launching cpuminer to mine verthash is the same as any other algorithm,
no extra options are required.
